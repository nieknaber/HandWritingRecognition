# HandWritingRecognition

We do all in Python. Python 3.7.
All array structures are in Numpy.

Line Segmentation: an array of cut-out segment of a line of characters; that means, a 3D array of boolean values (0,1).

File process.py contains execution code.
In the end of the file a list of slant and slope normalized line segments is present which can be used for character segmentation.
Some features are already present that can later be used for style identification.
