To run our code, please set up a new Python 3 virtual environment by running ```python3 -m venv newvenv``` and ```source newvenv/bin/activate```. After that, install all dependencies using ```pip install -r requirements.txt```. 
You can then run our program by executing ```python main.py path/to/test/images/ ``` (note the last ```/```). The results are stored in a folder called ```results```. 

For those who feel so inclined, there are some tuneable parameters in ```main.py``` on line 8-10 and ```pipeline_controller.py``` on line 69-73. These have been the subject of meticulous parameter tuning, however, so your mileage may vary.
